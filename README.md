      The targets of our consulting mission 

The main objective of the assignment is to carry out a relatively comprehensive and well-developed competitive analysis. 
This will involve listing Opinum's main competitors and trying to gain a better understanding of their sector of activity, 
their way of working and, above all, to identify their key success factors. 
This monitoring will make it possible to study the competitors' business models in order to draw out the main areas for consideration in order to present Opinum with
potential strategic recommendations to Opinum. The monitoring will have an international dimension in order to explore the market as fully as possible. 
The second major objective will be to draw up a new pricing strategy for the smaller players. 
To do this, we will need to simulate pricing for this segment in order to understand and integrate the current pricing policy 
and then compare it with competing strategies. On this basis, it will then be possible to implement one or more new pricing plans.
